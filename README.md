# Linux Friendly Games

The purpose of this list is to rank how Linux friendly a Game is based on the following criteria:

* Is it free of kernel level anticheat?
* Does it work natively on Linux without wine/proton?
* Does it work natively on Wayland without XWayland?
* Does it work on any libc (glibc/musl/uclibc/bionic)?
* Is it open source?
* Is it currently maintained/updated?

For more details about how is it evaluated pleas refer to [the evaluation guide](evaluation.md), follow it before submiting PR.

Note that games that are not playable on Linux should not even be listed, different than [AreWeAntiCheatYet](https://github.com/AreWeAntiCheatYet/AreWeAntiCheatYet).
