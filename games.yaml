  notes: |
    - Recently it started working natively on Wayland without requiring XWayland, but the steam overlay UI is still broken, and you still needs XWayland to open the Steam client.
    - It's extremely hard to test on other libc because Steam itself don't work on other libc.

    - It installs with gcompat and the launcher don't complain about missing symbols, but also don't play due to segmentation fault.
